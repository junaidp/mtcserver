This unique east-west perspective originally dates from before the reign of Louis XIV, but it was developed and extended by the gardener André Le Nôtre, who widened the Royal Way and dug&nbsp;the Grand Canal.\n<br>\n</p><p>In 1661 Louis XIV entrusted André Le Nôtre with the creation and renovation of the gardens of Versailles, which he considered just as important as the Palace. Work on the gardens was started at the same time as the work on the palace and lasted for 40 or so years. During this time André Le Nôtre collaborated with the likes of Jean-Baptiste Colbert, Superintendant of Buildings to the King from 1664 to 1683, who managed the project, and Charles Le Brun, who was made First Painter to the King in January 1664 and provided the drawings for a large number of the statues and fountains. Last but not least, each project was reviewed by the King himself, who was keen to see “every detail”. Not long after, the architect Jules Hardouin-Mansart, having been made First Architect to the King and Superintendant of Buildings, built the Orangery and simplified the outlines of the Park, in particular by modifying or opening up some of the groves.\n<br>\n</p><p>Creating the gardens was a monumental task. Large amounts of soil had to be shifted to level the ground, create parterres, build the Orangery and dig out the fountains and Canal in places previously occupied solely by meadows and marshes. Trees were brought in from different regions of France. Thousands of men, sometimes even entire regiments, took part in this immense project.\n</p><p><br>\nDiscover the palace’s majestic gardens during a VIP visit aided by one of the head gardeners of the palace and get the privilege of accessing what regular visitors can’t access.</p>","address":"Versailles","price":["€2500 up to 10 people"],"duration":["2h30"],"availableTime":["Monday to Sunday 10am to 7pm"],"links":[{"link":"https://en.chateauversailles.fr/discover/estate/gardens","explanation":"Official Website - The Gardens"}],"linkWithOtherExperience":[],"termsAndConditions":"<p>Bookings minimum 3 weeks in advance</p>","storyLineKeywords":["Versailles","Royal Palace","André Le Nôtre"]}

The Constituent Assembly tasked five deputies – Démeunier, La Luzerne, Tronchet, Mirabeau et Redon – with examining the various draft declarations, combining them into a single one and presenting it to the Assembly. Article by article, the French declaration was voted on between 20 and 26 August 1789.
