66000f783b3a2d7cf3c2c334,VIP Visit of the Palace's Gardens,65ff02c2e1b82f7ea737f8e3,,,,,,,"<p>Visitors looking through the central window in the Hall of Mirrors will see the Grande Perspective stretching away towards the horizon from the Water Parterre. This unique east-west perspective originally dates from before the reign of Louis XIV, but it was developed and extended by the gardener André Le Nôtre, who widened the Royal Way and dug&nbsp;the Grand Canal.
<br>
</p><p>In 1661 Louis XIV entrusted André Le Nôtre with the creation and renovation of the gardens of Versailles, which he considered just as important as the Palace. Work on the gardens was started at the same time as the work on the palace and lasted for 40 or so years. During this time André Le Nôtre collaborated with the likes of Jean-Baptiste Colbert, Superintendant of Buildings to the King from 1664 to 1683, who managed the project, and Charles Le Brun, who was made First Painter to the King in January 1664 and provided the drawings for a large number of the statues and fountains. Last but not least, each project was reviewed by the King himself, who was keen to see “every detail”. Not long after, the architect Jules Hardouin-Mansart, having been made First Architect to the King and Superintendant of Buildings, built the Orangery and simplified the outlines of the Park, in particular by modifying or opening up some of the groves.
<br>
</p><p>Creating the gardens was a monumental task. Large amounts of soil had to be shifted to level the ground, create parterres, build the Orangery and dig out the fountains and Canal in places previously occupied solely by meadows and marshes. Trees were brought in from different regions of France. Thousands of men, sometimes even entire regiments, took part in this immense project.

As you fly over this haven of peace, a few kilometres from the hustle and bustle of the capital, the choice of this destination is obvious. The spectacle is simply awe-inspiring. No doubt the Sun King himself would have tasted the attraction. With the wind, the landscapes pass by: Moret-sur-Loing, the small medieval town; the bocage of Gâtinais, the valleys of the Seine, Yonne or Loing dotted with its many locks. From the basket, the Ile de France reveals forgotten and sometimes even unsuspected charms. This destination is the promise of an enchanted break in the life of a day-long aeronaut.</p>",Chateau de Fontainebleau,1300 - 4 people,2600 - 7-8 people,3150 - 9-12 people,3h service with 1h flight,,,Sunset from April to the end of October,Sunrise from April to the end of October,no,no,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"<p>Bookings minimum 2 weeks in advance

66164d43d29b6f258ba3d202,The Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen,66017c8558cd005ba7eb4781,,,,,,,"<p>Inspired by the American Declaration of Independence in 1776 and the spirit of the Enlightenment, the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen of 1789 marked the beginning of a new political era. Since then, it has never ceased to be a reference text. </p><p>The French Republic explicitly states its attachment to it, citing it in the preamble of its Constitution, and the Constitutional Council recognized its constitutional value in 1971.  </p><p>The Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen came into existence in the summer of 1789, born of an idea of the Constituent Assembly, which was formed by the assembly of the Estates General to draft a new Constitution, and precede it with a declaration of principles. &nbsp; There were many proposals. The Constituent Assembly tasked five deputies – Démeunier, La Luzerne, Tronchet, Mirabeau et Redon – with examining the various draft declarations, combining them into a single one and presenting it to the Assembly. Article by article, the French declaration was voted on between 20 and 26 August 1789. In its preamble and its 17 articles, it sets out the “natural and inalienable” rights, which are freedom, ownership, security, resistance to oppression; it recognizes equality before the law and the justice system, and affirms the principle of separation of powers.<br><br>During this highly exclusive experience, you will get the rare privilege of seeing the original of the&nbsp;Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen, as well as several authentic preparatory drafts and historical documents. These documents are not just a treasure of France but of mankind.&nbsp;<br><br></p>","60 rue des Francs-Bourgeois, 75003 Paris",€25000,,,90 mins,,,Monday to Friday 10am to 5pm,Saturday 10am to 4pm,"https://www.elysee.fr/en/french-presidency/the-declaration-of-the-rights-of-man-and-of-the-citizen#:~:text=History-,The%20Declaration%20of%20the%20Rights%20of%20Man%20and%20of%20the,There%20were%20many%20proposals.",French Presidency - Declaration text and explanation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,<p>Booking more than 2 months in advance</p><p>Security clearance is needed in advance.

Whether one feels for Marie or not, one must admit her trial was a mockery of justice.
